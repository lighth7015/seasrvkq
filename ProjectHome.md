A server daemon for home-made SEA protocol - simple LAN Instant Messaging system. The protocol is ugly by design and is not recommended.

But it could serve as a teaching example of using BSD's kqueue()/kevent() facilities in a real world application: see comments marked `KQ FEATURE` in the source code.

Server itself (source code comments/docs) is in English, but client and other docs are in Russian, though.
